        during her maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224

            the deadliest sinking of a single ship</a>
        up to that time. It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an ocean liner or cruise ship. The disaster drew
        public attention, provided foundational material for the disaster film genre, and has inspired many artistic
        works.

    <p>RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three Olympic-class
        ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas
        Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. Titanic was under the command of
        Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the
        world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe,
        who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>The name Titanic derives from the Titans of Greek mythology. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in what was then the
        United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, RMS Titanic was the second of the three Olympic-class ocean
        linersâ€”the first was RMS Olympic and the third was HMHS Britannic. They were by far the largest vessels of the
        British shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912. The three
        ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, and
        the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the International
        Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM).</p>

    <h2>Sinking</h2>

    <p>At 11:40 pm (ship's time) on 14 April, lookout Frederick Fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of Titanic
        and alerted the bridge. First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship to be steered around the iceberg and the
        engines to be reversed, but it was too late. The starboard side of Titanic struck the iceberg, creating a series
        of holes below the waterline. The hull was not punctured, but rather dented such that its seams buckled and
        separated, allowing water to rush in. Five of the watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear
        that Titanic would sink, as she could not remain afloat with more than four compartments flooded. She began
        sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.
    </p>

    <p>Those aboard Titanic were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance with accepted practices of the time,
        as ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue
        vessels, Titanic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board; if the ship had carried her
        full complement of about 3,339 passengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the
        lifeboats. The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. The officers did not know how
        many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full. Third-class
        passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the
        ship filled with water. The "women and children first" protocol was generally followed when loading the
        lifeboats, and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard. Women and children survived at rates of
        about 75 percent and 50 percent, while only 20 percent of men survived.
